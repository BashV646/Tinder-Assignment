## Installation

    1.Clone the repository or download the source code.
    2.Install a local server environment such as XAMPP or WAMP.
    3.Create a new database in PHPMyAdmin with the name 'tinder'.
    4.Use the ERD provided in the design folder to create the necessary tables and relationships in the 'tinder' database.
    5.Once the tables have been created, you can import sample data or create your own profiles in the 'users' table using PHPMyAdmin or your preferred database management tool.
    6.Copy the project files into the htdocs folder in your local server environment.
    7.Open the project in your browser by navigating to http://localhost/tinder/.

## Usage
