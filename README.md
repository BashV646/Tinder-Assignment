# Tinder-Assignment
An assignment was given to me by my instructor for web fundamentals course in Thomas More University of Applied Sciences.
The task was mainly focussed on the backend concerning PHP and the SQL database.
ERD and Wireframe are in the "Design Folder".
All code was written from scratch and took 70 hours taking in account that this was my first ever full-stack web-app project.
